## Activity 2: MG2 Progress
[Commits Made](https://github.com/UCI-GDIM32-W25/mg2-JeremyC140/commits/main/)
I finished the assets setup, the jumping of penguin (and isGrounded check), the UI with TMP_text (but not yet the update part), collision check in the penguin script, and attempt on the coin moving script as well as the game controller. 
TO-DO:
- Fix the bugs that coins are not instantiate in the right posision
- Fix coins not moving
- Assign enough variables to update the text
